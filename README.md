# FullName-and-DOB-Generator
Full Names and Dates of Birth Generator
Generate full names and dates of birth from a CSV file!

Instructions

Place the generate_full_names_dob.py script in the same directory as your input CSV file.

Make sure your input CSV file has a header row and two columns: "Full Name" and "DOB".

Run the script:


python generate_full_names_dob.py

🎉 Enjoy your shiny new CSV file full of full names and dates of birth! 

🎉Tips
Make sure your input CSV file is formatted correctly. If the script is having trouble reading the file, it might be because of an extra comma or a missing quotation mark.
If you want to change the output file name or location, you can modify the outfile variable in the script.
Have fun with it! 😊 You can use this script to generate all sorts of weird and wacky full names and dates of birth. Just make sure to keep it legal and ethical.
